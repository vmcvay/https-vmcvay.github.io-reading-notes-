# **Introduction**

## I'm Vernessa McVay, a 53 year-old music lover, aspirant hiker and a mother. I'm also a woman who's looking to my new found growth mindset to change the trajectory of my life.

## For me, growth mindset is _accomplishment_ through developing my talent, creativity and intelligence through perserverance, a willingness to see another way through challenges, and managing procrastination. 

## The 3 reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:
### - tapping into my creativity and remaining there
### - being quick to praise and slow to criticize, not just others, but myself, and 
### - remembering that short-term frustration will eventually result in long-term improvement of my abilities.
